Use in Kingdoms of heckfire to see what time to send out your dragons for the resource gathering event

There's a lot of hard coding and r/shittyprogramming content here so if you'll be using this commit, you have to spend approximately 20 minutes entering your dragon gathering time in the <biomename.txt> file. Ignore the stats.txt file. You also have to update the file anytime you rank up your dragons or do something that would affect gathering times.
